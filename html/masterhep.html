	<h5>Important Note to Residents Outside North Carolina</h5>
	<p>Admission of applicants residing outside the State of North Carolina to an online degree, certificate program or individual online course offered by East Carolina University, is dependent on ECU&#39;s ability to secure authorization from the applicant&#39;s state of residence, if such authorization is required. Due to evolving changes in higher education regulations, at this time, ECU is unable to serve all of the students that are interested in our courses or programs. ECU will no longer be able to offer distance education online programs or courses for students residing in Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Maryland, and Ohio. For the most current list of states, visit this link <a href="http://eai.ecu.edu/states">http://eai.ecu.edu/states</a>. ECU will work with state authorities to allow students in these states who are currently enrolled in an ECU online or certificate program to complete their degree.</p>
	<p>Additionally, students enrolled in programs or courses that require internships or supervised clinical placements will be unable to complete these activities in the state listed.</p>
	<p>For questions specific to the state authorization process, call 252/737-1268 or email <a href="/cs-hhp/hlth/destateauth@ecu.edu">destateauth@ecu.edu</a>.</p>
